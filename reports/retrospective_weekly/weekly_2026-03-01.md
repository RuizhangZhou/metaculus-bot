### Research Summary
The research examines whether Robinhood Markets, Inc. (HOOD) will have a higher market close price on 2026-02-27 compared to 2026-02-17, using Yahoo Finance data for resolution. The criteria are straightforward: if HOOD’s closing price on 2026-02-27 exceeds $75.97 (the close on 2026-02-17), the answer is Yes; otherwise, No. The research reviews recent financial results, noting that HOOD reported record revenues and earnings for 2025, but missed Wall Street’s Q4 revenue expectations, which led to a negative market reaction and increased share price volatility. Following the earnings release, HOOD’s share price experienced significant fluctuations, with reported prices ranging from $71.12 to $78.71 in the days after February 10, 2026.

Analyst sentiment is generally bullish for the long term, but has become more cautious in the near term due to the earnings miss, concerns about slowing user growth, and margin pressures. Several analysts have recently lowered their price targets, though the consensus target remains well above current prices. No direct prediction market exists for this specific price comparison. As of the latest data, HOOD’s share price hovers around the $75.97 threshold, sometimes above and sometimes below, reflecting ongoing uncertainty and both upside and downside risks in the short term.

### Research Summary
The research summarizes the criteria for resolving whether Ares Management Corporation’s (ARES) market close price on 2026-02-24 will be higher than its close price on 2026-02-17, using Yahoo Finance API data and accounting for stock splits or delisting. Recent events include ARES’s Q4 CY2025 earnings miss, which resulted in a significant stock price drop from $137.22 to $124.16 after earnings were reported on February 5, 2026. As of February 6, 2026, the stock traded at $124.16, notably below the reference price of $133.88 from February 16, 2026. Analysts maintain a moderately bullish outlook with 12-month price targets around $190, but short-term sentiment is cautious due to the earnings miss and management’s warning about lower base rates affecting 2026 earnings.

There is no indication of a stock split, reverse split, or delisting as of February 17, 2026, and no relevant prediction markets are forecasting ARES’s price movement for the specified dates. The outcome will depend on whether ARES’s closing price on February 24, 2026, exceeds $133.88. The research highlights uncertainty due to recent negative earnings news, but notes that longer-term analyst sentiment remains positive. Key factors influencing the outcome include market sentiment, economic conditions, and any company-specific developments before the resolution date.

### Research Summary
The research summarizes the criteria and current context for determining whether Ares Management Corporation’s (ARES) market close price on 2026-02-24 will be higher than its close price on 2026-02-17. The resolution depends on the official closing prices from Yahoo Finance, with $133.88 as the baseline close on 2026-02-17. Stock splits and delisting scenarios are accounted for, and no ambiguous terms are present. As of the latest data, ARES experienced significant volatility following a Q4 2025 earnings miss, which led to a sharp price drop from $137.22 to $124.16. Despite this, the company reported strong year-over-year growth in assets under management (AUM), now exceeding $622 billion, and maintains a positive analyst consensus with 12-month price targets around $192.

The stock has been volatile, declining 23.5% in the month leading up to the earnings report. No recent stock splits, reverse splits, or major corporate actions have been reported. Analyst sentiment remains positive, but these f

### Research Summary
The research outlines the criteria for determining whether interest in “gisele pelicot” changes between 2026-02-17 and 2026-02-26, based on Google Trends data for the US. The resolution depends on the “interest over time” values for these dates, as provided by SerpApi from the official Google Trends URL. A change is defined as an increase or decrease of more than 3 points; otherwise, the interest is considered not to have changed. The research clarifies that “interest” refers strictly to the Google Trends value, not actual search volume, and that the SerpApi output is the authoritative source.

The research also notes that, as of February 16, 2026, the value for “gisele pelicot” is 58, with no indication of significant news, events, or prediction market activity that might affect interest in the term. No relevant contracts or discussions were found on major prediction market platforms, and no news coverage or viral events related to “gisele pelicot” have been identified. The research highlights that, barring unexpected developments, the value is likely to remain stable, but the outcome will be determined strictly by the specified Google Trends data.

### Research Summary
The research outlines the criteria for determining whether interest in the search term “gisele pelicot” will change between 2026-02-17 and 2026-02-26, using Google Trends data for the US as the authoritative source. The resolution depends on the difference in Google Trends values for these dates: if the value on 2026-02-26 is within 3 points (inclusive) of the value on 2026-02-17, the outcome is “Doesn't change”; if it is more than 3 points higher, it is “Increases”; and if more than 3 points lower, it is “Decreases.” The research notes that Google Trends values are relative and can shift, but the use of fixed dates and the SerpApi API should ensure consistent measurement.

The research also finds no evidence of recent news, events, or viral activity related to “gisele pelicot” that might affect search interest during the specified period. No prediction markets currently offer contracts on this topic, and there is no indication from available sources that a significant change in search interest is expected. The most recent Google Trends value available (as of February 16, 2026) is 58, and the context suggests a stable trend. Some uncertainty remains due to the nature of Google Trends data, but no major fluctuations are anticipated based on current information.

### Research Summary
The research outlines the criteria for determining whether Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN)'s market close price on February 27, 2026, will be higher than its close price on February 17, 2026, using data from the Yahoo Finance API. The resolution is straightforward: if the closing price on February 27 exceeds $164.32 (the closing price on February 17), the answer is YES; otherwise, it is NO. The research notes that stock splits, reverse splits, and potential delisting events are accounted for, and there is no ambiguity in the resolution criteria.

Recent news and analyst reports indicate that Coinbase remains a leading player in the U.S. crypto market, but its stock is highly sensitive to cryptocurrency price movements, particularly Bitcoin. While analysts maintain a generally bullish medium-term outlook with high price targets, they also highlight near-term risks, including a recent decline in crypto market capitalization and "soft" Q4 earnings. Coinbase is diversifying its business to reduce reliance on trading volumes, but faces ongoing headwinds in 2026. No major corporate events are expected between the two dates in question, and no relevant prediction market contracts exist for this specific event. The main uncertainties are short-term crypto market volatility and its impact on COIN's stock price.

### Research Summary
The research summarizes the criteria for resolving whether Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN)'s market close price on 2026-02-27 will be higher than its close price on 2026-02-17, using the Yahoo Finance API as the definitive source. It reviews COIN's recent performance, noting a rebound after Q4 earnings despite a 21.6% year-on-year revenue decline and a non-GAAP loss, with the market responding positively to management's guidance and product expansion efforts. Analyst consensus as of February 2026 is generally positive, with a long-term price target of $321.01, but this is not specific to the short-term window in question. The company is diversifying its revenue streams, notably through the launch of regulated prediction markets and increased subscriptions and services, though its stock remains highly cyclical and closely tied to crypto market trends, especially Bitcoin.

The broader crypto market context in early 2026 is cautiously optimistic, with regulatory progress and institutional adoption, but COIN faces headwinds from declining crypto prices and recent earnings misses. No direct prediction market exists f

### Research Summary
The research defines a precise method for determining how Google search interest in “les wexner” changes between 2026‑02‑17 and 2026‑02‑22, using Google Trends data accessed via SerpApi. It specifies that the only authoritative data is the SerpApi `google_trends` engine with `data_type="TIMESERIES"`, `geo="US"`, `tz=0`, `q="les wexner"`, and `date="2026-01-23 2026-02-22"`, with daily (1‑day) resolution in UTC. Because Google Trends rescales values within each selected date range, the research emphasizes that values from any other date window (such as a previously mentioned “last 30 days” range) are not comparable and must be ignored for resolution. Only the values returned for 2026‑02‑17 and 2026‑02‑22 within this fixed window are relevant.

The outcome is then categorized based on the absolute difference between those two daily interest scores. If the difference is 0–3 points inclusive, the result is “Doesn't change.” If the 2026‑02‑22 value exceeds the 2026‑02‑17 value by more than 3 points, the result is “Increases.” If the 2026‑02‑17 value exceeds the 2026‑02‑22 value by more than 3 points, the result is “Decreases.” The research clarifies that a 4‑point difference is not “within 3” and must be classified as either an increase or decrease. It also notes that the query is a plain search term (not a topic), that only US web search interest is considered, and that if the SerpApi script fails or the necessary data is unavailable, the question may be annulled or resolved manually. Finally, it highlights that the metric is relative search interest on a 0–100 scale, so even modest news or social media activity around those dates could shift the outcome.

### Research Summary
The research defines a precise method for determining whether interest in the Google search term “les wexner” changes between 2026‑02‑17 and 2026‑02‑22, using Google Trends data accessed via SerpApi’s `google_trends` engine. The data will be for the United States (`geo = "US"`), in UTC (`tz = 0`), for the query `q = "les wexner"` over the fixed date range `2026-01-23 2026-02-22`, with daily resolution. The authoritative source is explicitly the SerpApi API output, not what might be seen in a browser interface, and all dates are interpreted in UTC. Two values are defined: V₁₇, the Google Trends value for 2026‑02‑17, and V₂₂, the value for 2026‑02‑22, both taken from this same timeseries.

The outcome is categorized by comparing V₂₂ and V₁₇. If the absolute difference |V₂₂ − V₁₇| is 3 or less, the result is “Doesn't change.” If V₂₂ exceeds V₁₇ by more than 3 points (difference ≥ 4), the result is “Increases.” If V₂₂ is more than 3 points lower than V₁

### Research Summary
The research defines a precise resolution method for determining the value of the “1-Year Treasury Bill Secondary Market Rate, Discount Basis” on 2026-02-26 using the FRED series `DTB1YR`. The value will be pulled from the FRED API endpoint `https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=DTB1YR`, using the latest revised data available at the time of resolution. The series is treated as a daily, not-seasonally-adjusted percent rate, and the resolved number will be the exact “value” field returned by FRED (e.g., `"3.33"`), typically to two decimal places. The primary target is the observation dated 2026-02-26; if that is missing, the observation from 2026-02-25 will be used, provided the series is still classified as daily.

If neither 2026-02-26 nor 2026-02-25 is available, the script will continue checking for up to two weeks (through about 2026-03-12). If no matching datapoint appears by then, the question is annulled and no numeric value is used. The research notes several potential complications: FRED could change the series’ update frequency (which would alter the matching rules), historical data can be revised (so the value at resolution may differ from the first-published figure), and market holidays or weekends may lead to missing dates, which is why a “within 1 day previous” rule is applied. It also highlights that forecasters should think in terms of the 1-year T-bill discount rate in early 2026, its relationship to the expected federal funds rate path, and historical volatility, but the only concrete data point mentioned is a past value of 3.33% on 2026-02-12 as given in the prompt.

### Research Summary
The research outlines the resolution criteria for determining the value of the "Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 30-Year Constant Maturity, Quoted on an Investment Basis, Inflation-Indexed" (FRED series DFII30) on 2026-02-25. The value must be the latest revised data as published by the FRED API, specifically for 2026-02-25 or, if unavailable, for 2026-02-24. If the series is not updated daily, the acceptable window expands to 7 or 31 days for weekly or monthly updates, respectively. If no value is published within two weeks, the question is annulled. The research clarifies ambiguous terms such as "latest revised data" and "within 1 day previous," and notes that no major US holidays are expected to disrupt data publication on the target date.

Recent trends indicate that the 30-year inflation-indexed yield has been stable, with a value of 2.48% as of 2026-02-12, and no significant economic events have been reported that would likely cause abrupt changes. The research also notes that there are no active prediction markets specifically forecasting this yield for the target date, though related markets exist for nominal yields and central bank decisions. The resolution will depend on the value published by FRED for the specified date, and if no value is available within the allowed window, the question will be annulled.

### Research Summary
The research aims to determine the value of the "10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate" on February 23, 2026, using data from the FRED API for the series T10YIE. The resolution criteria specify that the value will be based on the latest revised data available at the time of assessment, with the data point needing to match the date 2026-02-23 or be within one day prior if the series is updated daily. If no data point is found after two weeks of checking, the question will be annulled. As of the latest available data, the 10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate was 2.27% on February 13, 2026, according to the FRED series T10YIE, which updates daily.

The research also notes the absence of specific prediction markets for the 10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate on the specified date. While general inflation prediction markets exist, they do not directly address this specific breakeven rate or date. Therefore, the conclusion is that the rate on February 23, 2026, will be determined by the FRED API data available at that time, with no market-implied probability available for this specific rate or date.

### Research Summary
The research defines the contract on Southern Company (SO) using Yahoo Finance’s split‑adjusted daily close as the reference price. The baseline is SO’s market close on 2026‑02‑17, and the comparison is the close associated with 2026‑02‑28 in Yahoo’s historical data. A “YES” outcome occurs if the 2026‑02‑28 close is strictly higher than the 2026‑02‑17 close; otherwise, the outcome is “NO.” If SO is delisted before 2026‑02‑28 (due to merger, acquisition, or other reasons), the final Yahoo‑reported close is compared to the 2026‑02‑17 close. Stock splits and reverse splits are explicitly handled via Yahoo’s split‑adjusted prices. There is an important ambiguity because 2026‑02‑28 is a Saturday: the effective comparison price will likely be the last trading day’s close before that date (probably 2026‑02‑27), as many APIs return the most recent trading day’s close when queried for a non‑trading day. There is also a minor ambiguity over whether “Close” or “Adj Close” is used, which only matters if a split occurs between the two dates.

The research then outlines the main drivers that could move SO’s price relative to the 2026‑02‑17 baseline over the roughly 11‑day window. Company‑specific factors include earnings results and guidance, regulatory decisions on allowed returns and cost recovery, progress or setbacks on large projects, and any M&A or strategic announcements. Macro and sector‑level influences include interest rate moves and Federal Reserve expectations (important for rate‑sensitive utilities), overall risk sentiment and sector rotation, and fuel/commodity price dynamics. The analysis also highlights the potential impact of an ex‑dividend date in this window, which typically causes a mechanical price drop, as well as the effects of buybacks, equity issuance, and low‑probability but high‑impact events such as delisting, mergers, or major accidents. Because the exact 2026‑02‑17 close and subsequent prices are not known within the research, it does not attempt to state how the question would resolve, but instead lists what additional data (prices, calendars, scheduled events, macro releases) should be gathered to refine a forecast.

### Research Summary
The research defines the event in terms of Southern Company’s (SO) *adjusted* closing prices from Yahoo Finance. The reference point is the adjusted close on 2026‑02‑17, and the outcome is determined by comparing this to the adjusted close on 2026‑02‑28. If the 2026‑02‑28 adjusted close is higher, the question resolves “Yes”; if it is equal or lower, it resolves “No.” If SO is delisted before 2026‑02‑28 (for example due to a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy), the final adjusted close before delisting is used instead, and the same higher‑vs‑not‑higher rule applies. The research notes that the exact 2026‑02‑17 adjusted close is unknown in the provided data (though a nearby close of 94.95 on 2026‑02‑16 is mentioned), and that the contract implicitly assumes prices in USD. It also highlights a procedural ambiguity if 2026‑02‑28 is not a trading day, since the contract text does not specify whether to use the prior or next trading day, or treat the question as ill‑posed.

To frame potential outcomes, the research outlines key drivers that could move SO’s price between the reference date a

### Research Summary
The research explains that this is a meta-question about another Metaculus question: “Will the winner of the 2026 FIFA World Cup be a country that has never won before?” It will resolve based on the Metaculus community prediction (recency‑weighted median forecast) for that target question at a specific timestamp: 2026‑02‑25 03:09:27. If at that moment the community prediction is strictly above 13.00%, the meta-question resolves Yes; if it is 13.00% or lower, it resolves No. If the underlying World Cup question resolves after this meta-question opens but before that timestamp, the meta-question simply inherits the Yes/No outcome of the original. If the underlying question had already resolved before the meta-question opened, the meta-question is annulled. As of 2026‑02‑16, the community prediction on the target question is exactly 13.00%, so any upward movement by the reference time would imply a Yes outcome under the main resolution path.

The research notes several technical ambiguities (time zone of the reference timestamp, possible future changes in how Metaculus defines “community prediction,” and whether comparisons use internal vs. rounded values), but assumes standard Metaculus practice (UTC and internal stored values). It also summarizes external football context: betting and pundit sources for 2026 World Cup winner odds heavily favor traditional powers (France, Spain, Brazil, England, Argentina, Germany), all of which are past winners and thus correspond to “No” outcomes on the original question. Dark-horse teams that have never won (e.g., United States, Japan, Morocco and others) are the main “Yes” candidates, but are generally priced as long shots. No external prediction market directly on “new winner vs. past winner” was found; instead, existing markets and articles focus on individual team winner odds. The research suggests that any change in the Metaculus community prediction will likely be driven by evolving information about team strength (qualifying results, injuries, form), shifts in betting/model probabilities for dark horses, and Metaculus-specific dynamics (tournaments, discussion, or platform changes) that might prompt forecasters to revise the 13% estimate up or down.

### Research Summary
The research outlines that the value of the "30-Year Fixed Rate Veterans Affairs Mortgage Index" (OBMMIVA30YF) for 2026-02-26 will be determined by the value published on the FRED API for that date, or, if unavailable, the most recent prior day (within one day). The FRED series is updated daily and reflects average rate locks for VA 30-year fixed mortgages, with recent values showing a slight downward trend: 5.739% on 2026-02-09, 5.700% on 2026-02-10, 5.690% on 2026-02-11, and 5.633% on 2026-02-12. The next scheduled update is on February 17, 2026, and the pattern of daily updates suggests the value for 2026-02-26 should be available shortly after that date.

The research also clarifies that if no value is published for 2026-02-26 or the previous day within two weeks, the question will be annulled. No prediction markets currently offer contracts on this index. The only authoritative source for the resolution is the FRED API for OBMMIVA30YF.

### Research Summary
The research explains how the Metaculus meta-question will be resolved based on the community prediction (CP) for the underlying Nvidia question, “Will Nvidia's stock price close below $100 on any day in 2026?” at a specific time: 2026-02-26 08:50:50 (time zone not explicitly stated, likely UTC but ambiguous). If, at that exact time, the Nvidia question is still open, the meta-question’s outcome depends solely on the CP: it resolves Yes if CP(t) > 12.00% and No if CP(t) ≤ 12.00%. As of 2026-02-16, the CP is 12.00%, but this is just a snapshot and not itself determinative. The research also notes ambiguity about how “community prediction” is defined if Metaculus changes its aggregation method, and about the exact time zone used for the timestamp.

If the Nvidia question resolves before the meta-question opens, the meta-question is annulled. If the Nvidia question resolves after the meta-question opens but before 2026-02-26 08:50:50, then the meta-question simply inherits the Yes/No resolution of the Nvidia question, and the CP at the timestamp becomes irrelevant. The Nvidia question itself resolves Yes if, on any regular 2026 trading day, Nvidia’s adjusted closing price (using Yahoo Finance as the primary source, with possible fallback to other “credible sources”) is below $100, with the threshold adjusted for any stock splits; otherwise it resolves No. The research outlines three main resolution pathways for the meta-question (annulment, inheritance from the target question, or CP-based resolution at the timestamp) and emphasizes that, given the lack of live data, nothing can be said about actual NVDA price movements or CP changes beyond the provided 12.00% figure on 2026-02-16.

### Research Summary
The research describes a meta-question on Metaculus that depends on the community prediction (CP) for the underlying question “Will Nvidia's stock price close below $100 on any day in 2026?” (https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40972). The meta-question resolves based on the CP at a specific timestamp, 2026-02-26 08:50:50: it resolves “Yes” if the CP at that moment is strictly greater than 12.00%, and “No” if it is less than or equal to 12.00%. As of 2026-02-16, the CP for the target question is exactly 12.00%. The CP is defined as Metaculus’s recency-weighted median of user forecasts, and there is a minor ambiguity about what happens if Metaculus changes its aggregation method, but the intended interpretation is to use whatever is displayed as the CP at that time. There is also a minor ambiguity about the exact time zone of the resolution timestamp.

The research also details special cases where the resolution of the meta-question is tied directly to the resolution of the target question. If the target question had already resolved before the meta-question opened, the meta-question is annulled. If the target resolves after the meta-question opens but before 2026-02-26 08:50:50, then the meta-question simply takes the same Yes/No outcome as the target, regardless of the CP at the timestamp. The target question itself resolves “Yes” if Nvidia’s adjusted closing price (using Yahoo Finance: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/history/) falls below an adjusted $100 threshold on any regular trading day in 2026,

### Research Summary
The research explains how the value of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for 2026‑02‑26 will be determined using the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) series “SOFR.” The relevant series is daily, in percent, not seasonally adjusted, and will be accessed via the FRED API endpoint `https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=SOFR`. The question resolves to whatever numeric value FRED reports for the SOFR observation dated 2026‑02‑26, using the latest revised data available at the time of resolution. If an observation with date exactly “2026‑02‑26” exists, that value is used. There is a defined “within 1 day previous” matching rule for daily series: if 2026‑02‑26 is missing but 2026‑02‑25 exists and is the latest observation within that 1‑day window, the script may use that as a fallback, though this is noted as a minor ambiguity. If no suitable datapoint appears and the date seems to have been “clearly skipped,” the question is annulled after 2 weeks of checking with no value posted.

The research also clarifies that SOFR values can be revised, and the resolution will use the latest revision available at the time of resolution; any later revisions will not change the outcome. It notes that SOFR is typically published with a short lag (often the next business day), and that if 2026‑02‑26 is a non‑business day, FRED may instead show the rate for the last business day before that date, but the contract is tied strictly to the date field in the FRED series. As of the time the question was created, the last known data point in the prompt is 2026‑02‑12 with a value of 3.65 percent, but the actual value for 2026‑02‑26 is unknown. The research then outlines qualitative drivers that will influence SOFR up to that date—Federal Reserve policy (target range for the federal funds rate and balance sheet policy), repo market conditions (Treasury collateral supply, demand for secured funding, use of the Fed’s ON RRP facility), macro/financial stability events, and calendar effects (day‑of‑week and month‑end patterns). It emphasizes that the future policy path and market conditions are uncertain, that the last known value is not a reliable p

### Research Summary
The research explains that this is a Metaculus meta-question whose resolution depends entirely on the status and community prediction of the underlying Metaculus question “Will SpaceX successfully refuel a Starship in orbit during 2026?” (https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41142) at a specific timestamp, 2026‑02‑26 12:35:23 (platform time, likely UTC). There are three resolution paths: (1) if the target question had already resolved before the meta-question opened, the meta-question is annulled; (2) if the target question resolves at any time after opening but before the timestamp, the meta-question simply takes the same Yes/No result as the target, and the 40.00% threshold is ignored; (3) if the target question is still open at that timestamp, the meta-question resolves Yes if the Metaculus community prediction (recency-weighted median shown on the site) is strictly greater than 40.00%, and No if it is 40.00% or lower. As of 2026‑02‑16, the community prediction on the target question is exactly 40.00%, so any Yes outcome via the threshold rule would require an increase above that level by the specified time.

The research notes that external technical and programmatic developments around Starship refueling—such as the planned mid‑2026 Starship Propellant Transfer Demonstration for NASA’s Artemis program, recent Starship test flight performance, and any schedule changes or major announcements from SpaceX or NASA—are likely to influence forecasters and thus move the community prediction. It also reports that no directly matching prediction market (for either “Starship refueling in orbit during 2026” or “Metaculus CP > 40% by 2026‑02‑26”) was found in the provided search results, though related Starship markets exist on Manifold Markets and prediction markets on Musk/SpaceX timelines are mentioned more generally. The research suggests that, for personal forecasting, one should consider both the chance of early resolution of the target question (via an unexpectedly early refueling success or a clear delay/cancellation) and, if it remains open, the likely direction of short-term sentiment shifts around the 40% level in the 10 days leading up to 2026‑02‑26.

### Research Summary
The research outlines the criteria for resolving the question about the value of the "ICE BofA Single-B US High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread" (BAMLH0A2HYB) on 2026-02-25. The value will be taken from the FRED API for the specified series, using the latest revised data published for that date or the closest prior date if 2026-02-25 falls on a weekend or holiday. If no data is available after two weeks, the question is annulled. The series measures the spread between B-rated US high yield corporate bonds and US Treasuries, is updated daily, and is not seasonally adjusted.

As of 2026-02-17, the most recent available value is 3.19% for 2026-02-12, with earlier data (2026-01-09) at 2.93%. No significant market events have been reported that would affect the spread, and recent values indicate stable credit conditions in the 2.9–3.2% range. No relevant prediction markets exist for this specific question. The final resolution will depend strictly on the value published by FRED for the relevant date.

### Research Summary
The research explains that the question is about the Metaculus community prediction for “Will OpenAI file for an IPO during 2026?” at a precise timestamp on 2026-02-27, not about whether the IPO actually happens. It lays out the resolution rules: if the original IPO question is still open at that time, the meta-question resolves based solely on whether the community prediction is strictly above 41.00%; if the IPO question resolves after the meta-question opens but before that timestamp, the meta-question simply mirrors the IPO question’s Yes/No outcome; and if the IPO question resolves before the meta-question opens, the meta-question is annulled. As of 2026-02-16, the community prediction is exactly 41.00%, so even small changes in forecasts could determine the outcome.

The research then compiles recent news suggesting OpenAI is actively targeting a late‑2026 (Q4) IPO, with multiple outlets (Reuters, WebProNews, Fintool, Proactive Investors, and others) reporting informal talks with banks, very high private valuations ($500B–$830B, with speculation up to $1T), and a broader environment expecting 2026 to be a strong year for mega‑IPOs. It notes that OpenAI’s easy access to large private funding both reduces the necessity of an IPO and supports the plausibility of a very large public listing. Competitive pressure from Anthropic’s own IPO plans, the Elon Musk lawsuit as a potential delaying factor, and general market volatility are highlighted as key uncertainties. The research concludes that an S‑1 filing before 2026‑02‑27 is not indicated by current reporting, so the most relevant scenario is that the IPO question remains open and the meta-question’s resolution depends on where the Metaculus community prediction moves relative to 41% in response to this recent, mostly IPO‑positive news. No directly relevant, liquid prediction markets were found for this exact question.

### Research Summary
The research defines a binary outcome based on Roper Technologies, Inc. (ROP) common stock’s official “market close price” from Yahoo Finance. The baseline is the split‑adjusted close on 2026‑02‑18, and the comparison is the split‑adjusted close on 2026‑02‑24. The question resolves “YES” if the 2026‑02‑24 close is strictly higher than the 2026‑02‑18 close, and “NO” if it is equal to or lower. If a stock split or reverse split occurs between these dates, both prices must be adjusted to the same basis before comparison. In the event of delisting, merger, or bankruptcy, the “final close price” reported by Yahoo Finance is used; if the stock no longer trades on 2026‑02‑24, that final close is treated as the 2026‑02‑24 value. Some edge cases remain ambiguous: how to handle 2026‑02‑24 if it is a non‑trading day, or if trading is halted but the stock remains listed. The research notes that the platform’s usual practice would need to be observed for those situations. The close prices for 2026‑02‑18 and 2026‑02‑24 are not yet known in the research; at resolution time, the user must retrieve them from Yahoo Finance’s historical data and compare them mechanically.

The research then outlines factors that could influence ROP’s price between 2026‑02‑18 and 2026‑02‑24, without taking a position on the direction. Key drivers include: (1) earnings releases, guidance updates, or investor events that could shift expectations for growth, margins, and M&A; (2) macro conditions such as interest‑rate expectations, inflation data, and overall risk sentiment; (3) sector and peer performance in software, industrial technology, and related “quality compounder” names; (4) company‑specific news like acquisitions, divestitures, regulatory developments, major customer wins/losses, or changes in capital allocation; (5) short‑term technical and flow dynamics, including index and ETF flows, options positioning, and recent momentum; and (6) tail risks, both negative (market shocks, company‑specific problems) and positive (large, well‑received deals or unexpectedly strong results. The research emphasizes that, because future prices cannot be known in advance, the final outcome depends solely on the realized Yahoo Finance close prices on the specified dates and the mechanical comparison described above.

### Research Summary
The research defines the underlying asset as Roper Technologies, Inc. (ROP) common stock on its primary exchange, with closing prices taken from Yahoo Finance’s official “market close price” (regular-session close, not after-hours). The baseline is the split‑adjusted close on 2026‑02‑18, and the comparison is the split‑adjusted close on 2026‑02‑24. The outcome is set to resolve “YES” if the 2026‑02‑24 close is strictly higher than the 2026‑02‑18 close, and “NO” if it is equal to or lower. Stock splits or reverse splits between these dates must be normalized so both prices are on the same split‑adjusted basis. If ROP is delisted (e.g., via merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy) before 2026‑02‑24, the final trading day’s close is used instead of a 2026‑02‑24 price and compared to the 2026‑02‑18 close. Edge cases like trading halts or ambiguous delisting timing are noted, with the general principle that if the final or last recorded close i

### Research Summary
The research explains that the question will resolve to the value of the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) series VXVCLS, titled “CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index,” on a date matching 2026-02-26 under specific rules. The resolution script will query the FRED API endpoint `https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=VXVCLS`, use the latest revised data available at the time of resolution, and first look for an observation dated 2026-02-26. If that date is missing, it will fall back to 2026-02-25, which is considered a valid match because it is within one day prior. Dates outside that window (e.g., 2026-02-24 or 2026-02-27) are not eligible. If neither 2026-02-26 nor 2026-02-25 appears in FRED for about two weeks after checking begins, the question is annulled and does not resolve to a number. The final answer, if it resolves, is a single index value (e.g., 22.17), in “Index” units, not seasonally adjusted, incorporating any revisions made before the script runs.

At the time the question was created, the last available data point mentioned is 22.17 on 2026-02-12, indicating that FRED was publishing the series with daily frequency up to at least that date. The research notes that there is no information provided about values between 2026-02-13 and 2026-02-26, nor about any structural changes to the index or its publication. It outlines qualitative drivers of the index level on 2026-02-26—such as equity market conditions, macroeconomic and policy developments, the volatility term structure, and potential event risks around that period—while also highlighting risks related to data continuity, possible revisions, and market holidays that might shift the effective observation date to 2026-02-25. It suggests a general forecasting framework (historical distribution analysis, macro scenarios, event risk assessment, and term-structure considerations) but does not provide any numerical forecast itself.

### Research Summary
The research explains that the user’s question is tied to a specific Metaculus question about whether METR will estimate that some AI model reaches an 80% time horizon of at least 3 hours during 2026. The user’s question can resolve in two ways: (1) “shadow resolution mode,” where if the original Metaculus question resolves after the user’s question opens but before 2026-02-28 06:16:58, the user’s question simply copies that Yes/No outcome; or (2) “community-prediction snapshot mode,” where if the original question is still open at that timestamp, the user’s question resolves Yes if the Metaculus community prediction is strictly greater than 65.00% at that moment, and No otherwise. Edge cases are clarified: if the target question resolves before the user’s question opens, the user’s question is annulled; “community prediction” is whatever Metaculus is displaying as such at the time; and “higher than 65.00%” is a strict inequality, so 65.00% itself would resolve to No.

The research also summarizes the status of METR’s time-horizon work and related forecasting signals as of 2026-02-18. METR has released an updated methodology (“Time Horizon 1.1”) and continues to publish 50% and 80% time-horizon estimates for frontier models, with the best known 80% time horizon previously at 31 minutes for GPT‑5.1‑Codex‑Max. There is no indication in the cited material that any model has yet reached an 80% time horizon of 3 hours or more, and the Metaculus question appears to still be open. The Metaculus community prediction for the target question was 65.00% on 2026-02-16, exactly at the threshold relevant to the user’s question. External prediction markets on Manifold mirror the same event and related METR time-horizon milestones, indicating active trader interest and non-trivial probability assigned to substantial time-horizon gains in 2026, though the exact prices are not specified in the excerpts.

### Research Summary
The research explains how the question will be resolved using the FRED series “ICE BofA 7–10 Year US Corporate Index Effective Yield” (ID: BAMLC4A0C710YEY), which is a daily, not seasonally adjusted percentage series. On or after 2026‑02‑26, an automated script will query the FRED API (`https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=BAMLC4A0C710YEY`) and look for an observation whose date falls within one day prior to 2026‑02‑26. If a data point exists for 2026‑02‑26, that value is used; if not, a value from 2026‑02‑25 may be used, assuming the script selects the most recent observation in that one‑day window. The series uses the latest revised data available at the time of resolution, so any back‑revisions by ICE/FRED will be incorporated. If no suitable data point appears within two weeks of checking, or if the date is clearly skipped for structural reasons, the question is annulled rather than resolved to a number. Weekend/month‑end quirks are noted but are not expected to affect 2026‑02‑26, which is a Thursday.

The research also describes what the index measures and how one might think about forecasting its value. The ICE BofA 7–10 Year US Corporate Index Effective Yield is the yield to maturity on a basket of USD‑denominated, investment‑grade corporate bonds with 7–10 years remaining maturity, reflecting both the underlying 7–10 year US Treasury yields (risk‑free component) and the credit spread for investment‑grade corporates, including accrued interest and bond pricing. Key drivers through early 2026 include the Federal Reserve’s policy path, inflation expectations, term premium, macro growth conditions, and corporate credit risk and liquidity. The research outlines how recessions, soft landings, or inflationary scenarios could differently affect Treasury yields and credit spreads, and emphasizes that the 7–10 year bucket is particularly sensitive to long‑term rate expectations and yield curve shape. It proposes a scenario‑based forecasting framework: decomposing the yield into Treasury plus spread, defining macro regimes (s

### Research Summary
The research outlines that the question will be resolved by comparing the Google Trends “interest over time” values for the search term “nancy guthrie breaking news” in the US on 2026-02-18 and 2026-02-24, using SerpApi data from the official Google Trends URL. The resolution criteria are precise: if the value on 2026-02-24 is more than 3 points higher or lower than on 2026-02-18, the outcome is “Increases” or “Decreases” respectively; if the difference is within 3 points, it resolves as “Doesn't change.” The research does not provide a direct answer but establishes the methodology and authoritative sources for determining the outcome.

The context for this research is the ongoing, high-profile disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, which has generated significant media coverage and public interest, as well as active prediction markets (such as Polymarket) speculating on related developments. News updates, law enforcement activity, and public appeals are likely to influence search interest during the period in question. However, as of 2026-02-18, the outcome cannot be determined until both dates’ Google Trends values are available. The research draws on sources including Google Trends ([https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=nancy%20guthrie%20breaking%20news&date=2026-01-25%202026-02-24](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=nancy%20guthrie%20breaking%20news&date=2026-01-25%202026-02-24)), Google News ([https://news.google.com/?ceid=US%3Aen&gl=US&hl=en-US&topic=w](https://news.google.com/?ceid=US%3Aen&gl=US&hl=en-US&topic=w)), Deseret News ([https://www.deseret.com/politics/2026/02/09/timeline-of-nancy-guthrie-disappearance/](https://www.deseret.com/politics/2026/02/09/timeline-of-nancy-guthrie-disappearance/)), and Polymarket ([https://polymarket.com/event/nancy-guthrie-kidnapper-arrested-by-february-28](https://polymarket.com/event/nancy-guthrie-kidnapper-arrested-by-february-28)).

### Research Summary
The research defines a prediction contract based on Google Trends “interest over time” for the exact search term `"save act"` in the United States, using data from the SerpApi Google Trends TIMESERIES endpoint. The relevant query parameters are `geo=US`, `tz=0`, `q="save act"`, and `date="2026-01-27 2026-02-26"`. The contract compares the daily Google Trends index value (0–100, normalized within that 30‑day window) on 2026‑02‑18 (`V18`) with the value on 2026‑02‑26 (`V26`). It then computes Δ = V26 − V18 and resolves as “Doesn't change” if |Δ| ≤ 3, “Increases” if Δ > 3, and “Decreases” if Δ < −3. Exact threshold behavior is specified: Δ = +3 or −3 still counts as “Doesn't change,” and only changes of at least 4 points in either direction count as “Increases” or “Decreases.” The measurement is strictly the daily value for the search term (not a Google “topic”), with dates defined in UTC and daily granularity; intra‑day variation is irrelevant.

The research also clarifies that if there is any discrepancy between SerpApi’s output and the Google Trends web interface, the SerpApi TIMESERIES data are authoritative for resolution. It notes that Google Trends values are relative to the chosen date range, so example values from a different window (e.g., a value of 36 for 2026‑02‑16 in a 2026‑01‑17 to 2026‑02‑16 range) cannot be directly compared to values in the 2026‑01‑27 to 2026‑02‑26 window used for resolution. If SerpApi or Google Trends changes format, becomes unavailable, or the script fails, the question may be annulled or manually resolved by a moderator, though the exact criteria for manual resolution are not fully specified. The research does not provide actual values for V18 or V26 and therefore does not determine how the contract would resolve.

### Research Summary
The research defines a prediction contract based on Google Trends “interest over time” for the exact search term `"save act"` in the United States, using SerpApi’s Google Trends TIMESERIES endpoint as the sole authoritative source. The data are pulled for the fixed window `2026-01-27 2026-02-26` with `geo=US` and `tz=0`, and the daily values for 2026‑02‑18 and 2026‑02‑26 (UTC dates) are extracted. Letting `V18` and `V26` be the respective Google Trends index values (0–100) on those days, the outcome is determined by their difference: if `|V26 − V18| ≤ 3`, the result is “Doesn't change”; if `V26 − V18 > 3`, it is “Increases”; and if `V18 − V26 > 3`, it is “Decreases.” The research clarifies edge cases (e.g., a 3‑point difference still counts as “Doesn't change”), notes that values are integers and compared directly, and emphas

### Research Summary
The research outlines the criteria for determining the value of the NASDAQ 100 Index on 2026-02-26, specifying that the official closing value published by the FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) API for the series NASDAQ100 will be used. If the value for 2026-02-26 is unavailable, the value from the previous trading day (up to one day prior) will be used. If no data is published within two weeks, the question will be annulled. The research clarifies that only the latest revised data will be considered, and provides a summary of recent index values, which have ranged between 24,600 and 25,200 in mid-February 2026.

The research also reviews relevant market commentary and algorithmic forecasts, which suggest a continued bull market for the NASDAQ 100, driven by strong performance in technology and AI-related stocks. Forecasts for 2026 indicate potential values in the 28,000–30,000 range by year-end, though these are speculative and not specific to the resolution date. No prediction markets exist for the exact date in question, but related markets indicate high confidence that the index will remain above 24,320–24,340 in mid-February 2026. The final resolution will depend strictly on the value published by FRED for the specified date.

### Research Summary
The research explains how the Metaculus meta-question will be resolved based on the status of the underlying Artemis II question and its community prediction. If, at 2026-02-27 18:42:00 (likely UTC), the Artemis II question is still open, the meta-question’s outcome depends solely on the Metaculus “community prediction” shown at that moment: it must be strictly greater than 80.00% to count as “higher than 80.00%”; a value of exactly 80.00% or lower leads to a “No” resolution. If instead the Artemis II question resolves after the meta-question opens but before that timestamp, the meta-question simply inherits the same Yes/No outcome as the Artemis II question, regardless of what the community prediction is on 2026-02-27. If the Artemis II question had already resolved before the meta-question opened, the meta-question is annulled and does not resolve Yes or No.

The research also summarizes what makes the Artemis II question itself resolve Yes or No. It resolves Yes if, before January 1, 2027, Artemis II both (1) flies within 20,000 km of the lunar surface and (2) returns all crew safely to Earth. It resolves No if either condition is not met, or if the mission is delayed beyond 2026, canceled, or otherwise fails to complete those conditions in time. As of 2026-02-16, the community prediction on the Artemis II question is exactly 80.00%, which is at the threshold but not above it. The research notes that future changes in this prediction will be driven by developments in schedule (e.g., whether a firm launch date within the “No Later Than April 2026” window is maintained), technical readiness and safety of SLS and Orion, political and budget factors affecting Artemis, and the flow of new information (NASA announcements, tests, press coverage) that can shift forecaster sentiment on Metaculus.

### Research Summary
The research explains how the meta question is structured and what determines its resolution. It is tied to Metaculus question #40864 about whether NASA’s Artemis II will successfully complete its mission before 2027 (defined as reaching ≤20,000 km from the lunar surface and returning the crew safely before January 1, 2027). The meta question normally resolves based on the Metaculus community prediction for that Artemis II question at exactly 2026-02-27 18:42:00, using the standard “community prediction” metric (median of user forecasts weighted by recency). If at that moment the community prediction is strictly greater than 80.00%, the meta question resolves Yes; if it is 80.00% or lower, it resolves No. As of 2026-02-16, the community prediction is exactly 80.00%, which would correspond to a No if unchanged at the check time. There are some minor ambiguities noted, such as the exact time zone for the timestamp and the possibility that Metaculus could change how it defines “community prediction” in the future.

However, the research also details two important alternative resolution paths where the 80% threshold becomes irrelevant. If the Artemis II question resolves before the meta question even opens, the meta question is annulled. If t

### Research Summary
The research defines the target as the value of the FRED series BAMLHE00EHYIOAS (“ICE BofA Euro High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread”) associated with the date 2026‑02‑26, measured in percent. Resolution will use the FRED API (`https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=BAMLHE00EHYIOAS`) and the latest revised data available at the time of resolution. Because the series is daily, the script will first look for an observation dated 2026‑02‑26; if that is missing, it will fall back to 2026‑02‑25 (i.e., within one day prior). If neither date has a value and this gap persists for two weeks while later dates continue to appear, the question will be annulled rather than resolved to any other date. The value will be taken exactly as reported by the API (typically to two decimal places), and later revisions after resolution will not change the outcome.

The research notes that as of the time of writing, the last known value was 2.62% on 2026‑02‑12, and that subsequent values up to 2026‑02‑26 are unknown in this document. It explains what the index measures (the option‑adjusted spread of euro‑denominated high‑yield corporate bonds over a risk‑free curve) and outlines qualitative drivers that could move the spread between 2026‑02‑12 and 2026‑02‑26: euro‑area macro conditions, ECB policy stance, the credit cycle and default environment, global risk sentiment, technical market factors (issuance, flows, index effects), and idiosyncratic events such as large defaults or geopolitical shocks. It also suggests practical steps for forecasting, such as examining historical volatility of the series, checking for methodology changes or data gaps, and comparing with related credit indices and ECB communications, but does not provide a numerical forecast.

### Research Summary
The research specifies a precise, rule-based method for determining how Google search interest in the exact query `president day` changes between 2026‑02‑18 and 2026‑02‑26. It uses Google Trends “interest over time” data for the U.S. (`geo=US`), with UTC time (`tz=0`), over the date range 2026‑01‑27 to 2026‑02‑26. The data must come from the SerpApi Google Trends API, using the provided Python script, and daily values are extracted for 2026‑02‑18 (V₁) and 2026‑02‑26 (V₂). The outcome is then classified strictly by the difference on the 0–100 Google Trends scale: if |V₂ − V₁| ≤ 3, the interest “doesn’t change”; if V₂ − V₁ > 3, it “increases”; and if V₁ − V₂ > 3, it “decreases.” Any discrepancies between browser charts and the API are resolved in favor of the API output, and if the data cannot be obtained (e.g., API failure), the question may be annulled or manually resolved.

The research also notes contextual and methodological uncertainties. “President Day” is intended to capture interest around the U.S. holiday commonly known as Presidents Day, which typically produces a rise in search interest leading up to the holiday, a peak around the day itself, and a decline afterward. However, the exact daily values for 2026‑02‑18 and 2026‑02‑26 within the specified window are unknown until the SerpApi query is run after 2026‑02‑26, and the normalization of Google Trends data to the chosen date range means that a previously observed peak (e.g., a value of 100 on 2026‑02‑16 in a different 30‑day window) does not directly determine values in the 2026‑01‑27–2026‑02‑26 window. The research outlines possible hypothetical patterns (e.g., typical post‑holiday decline vs. continued rise or a flat tail) but treats all such scenarios as uncertain illustrations rather than measured outcomes.

### Research Summary
The research defines a three-way outcome based on Google Trends daily “interest over time” values for the exact query `president day` in the US, using SerpApi’s Google Trends TIMESERIES API as the sole authoritative source. The data will cover the period from 2026‑01‑27 to 2026‑02‑26 (UTC), and the key values are the daily interest scores on 2026‑02‑18 (`V18`) and 2026‑02‑26 (`V26`), each on Google Trends’ standard 0–100 relative scale normalized over that 31‑day window. The outcome categories are: “Doesn't change” if the absolute difference |V26 − V18| is 3 or less; “Increases” if V26 − V18 is greater than 3; and “Decreases” if V18 − V26 is greater than 3. Threshold behavior is explicitly defined (3 is included in “Doesn't change,” and “more than 3” is strictly > 3), and the comparison uses whatever numeric values SerpApi returns.

*Forecaster 5*: 51.96%


### Research Summary
The research explains that the question is about whether, at the exact timestamp 2026-02-25 17:11:42 (likely in UTC), the Metaculus community prediction for “Will Keir Starmer cease to be Prime Minister of the UK during 2026?” will be strictly greater than 60.00%. If at that moment the community prediction (CP) is above 60.00%, the question resolves Yes; if it is 60.00% or lower, it resolves No. As of 2026-02-16, the CP is exactly 60.00%, so if nothing changed by the resolution timestamp, the question would resolve No. The research notes that “higher than 60.00%” is a strict inequality, and that the CP is whatever Metaculus displays at that time, even if the aggregation method changes.

The research also details special cases. If the underlying Metaculus question about Starmer ceasing to be PM in 2026 resolves after this question opens but before 2026-02-25 17:11:42, then this question simply mirrors that resolution (Yes if Starmer is judged to have ceased being PM in 2026, No otherwise), regardless of the CP at the timestamp. If the target question resolves before this question opens, this question is annulled. The target question itself resolves Yes if Starmer ceases to be PM at any point before January 1, 2027, by any means (resignation, ouster, death, etc.), and No otherwise. The research also notes some ambiguities (e.g., exact time zone, edge cases where resolution and timestamp coincide, and what happens if the question is altered or hidden) and provides political context about Starmer’s low approval and Labour’s polling as of late 2025, while emphasizing that these background figures are taken at face value and not independently verified.

### Research Summary
The research explains how the Metaculus “meta-question” is defined and how it resolves. It tracks a target question on Metaculus: “Will Keir Starmer cease to be Prime Minister of the UK during 2026?” (https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40967). The meta-question resolves based on the Metaculus community prediction for that target question at a specific timestamp, 2026-02-25 17:11:42, but with important exceptions. If the target question is still open at that time, the meta-question resolves “Yes” if the internal Metaculus community prediction is strictly greater than 60.00%, and “No” if it is equal to or below 60.00%. The relevant value is the internal recency-weighted median used by Metaculus, not the rounded display value. If the target question resolves after the meta-question opens but before 2026-02-25 17:11:42, then the meta-question simply takes on the same Yes/No resolution as the target question, ignoring the 60% threshold entirely. If the target question had already resolved before the meta-question opened, the meta-question is annulled. As of 2026-02-16, the community prediction for the target question is exactly 60.00%, but the research notes that only the value at the later timestamp (or an earlier resolution of the target question) actually matters.

The research also restates how the original Starmer question itself resolves: it is “Yes” if at any point in 2026 (up to but not including 2027-01-01) Keir Starmer ceases to be UK Prime Minister for any reason (resignation, replacement, loss of confidence, death, etc.), and “No” if he rema

### Research Summary
The research defines a clear resolution rule using Yahoo Finance’s adjusted closing prices for PCAR (PACCAR Inc) on 2026‑02‑19 and 2026‑02‑27. The outcome is “Yes” if the 2026‑02‑27 adjusted close is strictly higher than the 2026‑02‑19 close, and “No” otherwise, with adjustments for any stock splits and a fallback to the final trading day’s close if the stock is delisted. It notes minor ambiguities such as how to handle a trading halt on 2026‑02‑27 but assumes standard Yahoo Finance regular-session closes. The research also emphasizes the need to explicitly record the exact 2026‑02‑19 closing price from Yahoo Finance as the baseline for any comparison.

Fundamentally, PCAR is described as being in a strong but mature up‑cycle, with Q4 2025 revenue beating expectations, EPS roughly in line, and 2025 marking one of the most profitable years in its history and its 87th consecutive year of profits. Management’s 2026 outlook calls for sequential growth, supported by new products, solid truck and parts demand, and strong profitability in parts and financial services, reaffirmed at a February 2026 analyst day. The company returns capital via dividends with a yield around 3%. Analyst commentary (e.g., Seeking Alpha) is broadly constructive, citing tight dealer inventories, expected demand pull‑forward from EPA 2027 emissions standards, and a localized manufacturing footprint, while also noting a premium valuation (~22x forward P/E). The research highlights recent price volatility around earnings, the absence of a dedicated prediction market for this specific price comparison, and outlines short‑term drivers between 2026‑02‑19 and 2026‑02‑27, including post‑earnings sentiment, potential analyst rating changes, macro/sector moves, and general market direction. It concludes with a practical checklist for forming a personal probability estimate based on fundamentals, valuation, technicals, and broader market conditions.

*Forecaster 4*: 51.21%
*Forecaster 5*: 49.15%


### Research Summary
The research defines the resolution mechanics for the question using Yahoo Finance’s *adjusted close* prices for DELL on 2026‑02‑20 and 2026‑02‑27. The outcome is “Yes” if the adjusted close on 2026‑02‑27 is strictly higher than on 2026‑02‑20, and “No” otherwise (including if it is equal). Prices are taken from the Yahoo Finance API for ticker DELL, with stock splits and reverse splits handled via split‑adjusted prices. If Dell is delisted before or on 2026‑02‑27, the final available adjusted close becomes the effective price for 2026‑02‑27. The text notes some ambiguity for cases where the market is unexpectedly closed on 2026‑02‑27, suggesting the latest prior close would likely be used, but emphasizing this is not explicitly specified. The “market close price” is interpreted as the regular-session close, including any early close.

For forecasting, the research highlights that this is a one‑week price comparison, so short‑term catalysts and volatility matter most. It recommends tracking Dell’s event calendar around that week, especially any earnings release, guidance, or analyst day, with focus on AI‑related server demand (ISG segment), PC demand and margins (CSG segment), and capital return policies. Sector and thematic drivers include the AI infrastructure cycle, PC refresh trends, and peer performance (e.g., HPE, HPQ, Cisco, Supermicro). Macro factors such as interest rates, key economic data releases, and overall equity risk sentiment are also flagged as relevant over this horizon. Additional considerations include potential corporate actions, regulatory or legal developments, operational issues, and technical/positioning factors like recent price momentum, options positioning, and support/resistance levels. The research ends with a practical checklist: record the 2026‑02‑20 reference price from Yahoo Finance, map upcoming events and macro data, assess baseline volatility versus catalysts, consider tail risks, and update the forecast as new information arrives.

### Research Summary
The research defines a binary outcome based on Dell Technologies Inc. (ticker: DELL) stock performance over a one‑week period. Using Yahoo Finance data, it compares the adjusted closing price on 2026‑02‑27 to the adjusted closing price on 2026‑02‑20. The market resolves “YES” if the 2026‑02‑27 adjusted close is strictly higher than the 2026‑02‑20 adjusted close; otherwise it resolves “NO.” Adjusted close is used so that stock splits or reverse splits are automatically accounted for. If DELL is delisted or trading ceases before 2026‑02‑27, the final available adjusted close (as reported by Yahoo Finance) is used instead. The research notes some ambiguities, such as the distinction between “market close price” and “adjusted close,” how to handle a full‑market holiday on 2026‑02‑27, and how corporate actions like special dividends or spin‑offs might affect adjusted prices.

The research does not determine an outcome, because it lacks the actual adjusted closing prices for 2026‑02‑20 and 2026‑02‑27. Instead, it outlines key factors that could influence DELL’s price over that week: timing and impact of earnings and guidance; developments in AI servers, data‑center demand, and PC/“AI PC” markets; macroeconomic and interest‑rate news; company‑s

### Research Summary
The research defines the question in terms of Lockheed Martin’s (LMT) official daily close prices from Yahoo Finance, adjusted for any stock splits. Let `C_20` be LMT’s close on 2026‑02‑20 and `C_26` its close on 2026‑02‑26; the event resolves “Yes” if `C_26 > C_20` and “No” otherwise. It notes that only splits are explicitly adjusted for, that delisting would use the final close price, and that the intent is to use the regular session close on both dates. As of 2026‑02‑16, LMT’s last reported close was $652.58, but the exact 2026‑02‑20 close is not yet known at the time of the research, and the 2026‑02‑26 close is necessarily unknown, so the question cannot yet be resolved.

The research compiles recent fundamental and market context: LMT reported 2025 sales of $75B (up 6% year‑over‑year), net earnings of $5B, EPS of $21.49, and a record $194B backlog. Its 2026 outlook calls for $77.5–80.0B in sales, $8.425–8.675B in business segment operating profit, EPS of $29.35–30.25, and $9.15–9.45B in cash from operations, broadly in line with or slightly above consensus. Following this guidance and a profit‑sharing deal tied to sharply higher missile production, the stock rose about 5% on Jan 29, 2026, trading in the high‑$620s to mid‑$630s in early February. The research notes strong demand in missiles and aeronautics, supported by elevated geopolitical tensions, and indicates that between Feb 20 and Feb 26 there are no known company‑specific catalysts, so short‑term price moves are likely to be driven by macro conditions, defense‑sector sentiment, and geopolitical or budget news. It also reports that no active prediction markets directly address the Feb 20 vs Feb 26 close comparison for LMT; the only related market found concerned an earlier earnings‑beat question.

### Research Summary
The research focuses on forecasting the value of the FRED series “Moody's Seasoned Aaa Corporate Bond Yield” (ID: DAAA) for the target date 2026‑02‑25, and on how that value will be resolved. The resolution will use the FRED API for series observations, taking the latest revised daily value in percent. The primary rule is to use the observation dated 2026‑02‑25; if that date is missing, the most recent observation within one day prior (i.e., 2026‑02‑24) may be used. If neither date is available and this remains unresolved for two weeks (for example, if the series stops updating or the date is clearly skipped and not backfilled), the question is annulled rather than resolved to a number. Revisions matter: the value in effect at the time of resolution, not the initially published value, is what counts.

Substantively, the research notes that the last known value at question creation is 5.27% on 2026‑02‑12, indicating an active series and a mid‑5% yield level shortly before the target date. It explains that DAAA reflects yields on long‑maturity Aaa‑rated corporate bonds and is driven mainly by long‑term U.S. Treasury yields plus an Aaa credit spread. Over a 13‑day horizon, typical daily moves are a few basis points, with larger shifts possible around major macro data releases, Federal Reserve decisions, or risk‑on/risk‑off episodes. The research outlines a suggested forecasting process: track the DAAA series up to the target date, decompose it into “risk‑free rate + spread” using long‑term Treasury yields, map upcoming macro and Fed events into yield scenarios, weigh trend continuation versus mean reversion, and then form a point estimate with an uncertainty band based on recent volatility and event risk. It also highlights potential structural risks (inflation surprises, growth or financial stability shocks, geopolitical events) that could move yields in either direction over the short window.

### Research Summary
The research defines a contract whose outcome depends on Google Trends “interest over time” for the query `george washington` in the US, using SerpApi’s Google Trends endpoint as the authoritative data source. It specifies fixed parameters (`geo=US`, `tz=0`, `q="george washington"`, `date="2026-01-26 2026-02-25"`) and extracts the daily index values for 2026‑02‑20 and 2026‑02‑25 (UTC). The result is categorized as “Doesn’t change” if the absolute difference between those two values is 3 points or less, “Increases” if the Feb 25 value is more than 3 points higher than Feb 20, and “Decreases” if it is more than 3 points lower. The scale is 0–100 within that fixed 30‑day window, with 100 as the peak interest in that period, and the SerpApi output is treated as final even if the Google Trends web UI differs. If the API fails or returns unusable data, the question may be annulled or manually resolved.

The research notes that as of 2026‑02‑16, “george washington” had a value of 100 in a slightly different 30‑day window (2026‑01‑17 to 2026‑02‑16), indicating a peak around Presidents’ Day, but this does not directly determine the values on Feb 20 or Feb 25 in the actual resolution window. It highlights seasonal drivers—Presidents’ Day (Feb 16, 2026) and Washington’s Birthday (Feb 22)—which typically cause a spike in searches followed by a tapering off, and mentions possible additional influences such as news events, educational cycles, and media coverage. The document also reports that no relevant prediction markets (on platforms like Polymarket, Kalshi, Manifold, or PredictIt) were found for this specific Google Trends question, so there are no market-implied probabilities to incorporate. Finally, it suggests that forecasters consider typical day‑to‑day volatility in Trends data and the narrow ±3 band that defines “Doesn’t change” when forming their own views.

### Research Summary
The research defines the question in terms of Qnity Electronics, Inc. (ticker Q, NYSE) and specifies that resolution depends solely on the official regular-session closing prices from Yahoo Finance for 2026-02-20 and 2026-02-26, adjusted for any stock splits. A “YES” outcome would occur if the 2026-02-26 close is strictly higher than the (split-adjusted) 2026-02-20 close; otherwise, including if equal, the outcome is “NO.” If Q is delisted before 2026-02-26, the final close before delisting is compared to the 2026-02-20 close. The research notes minor procedural uncertainty if trading is halted on 2026-02-26 and no close is printed. It also emphasizes that third-party quote discrepancies exist across data providers, but only Yahoo Finance’s closing prices matter for resolution, and that the exact 2026-02-20 close still needs to be pulled from Yahoo at the time of resolution.

The research compiles current information on Q as of mid‑February 2026, showing it trades on the NYSE with recent closes around $100–115 and near 52‑week highs, though different sites report slightly different prices, ranges, and earnings dates. It highlights key upcoming events between 2026-02-20 and 2026-02-26, especially a Q4/FY 2025 earnings report expected on or just before the resolution date and an ex‑dividend date on 2026-02-27, which may influence trading behavior but not the 2026-02-26 close mechanically. Analyst sentiment is described as generally bullish, with raised price targets and “Strong Buy” ratings, and the stock has shown nontrivial daily volatility typical of semiconductor-related names. The research did not find any existing prediction markets on this exact question and suggests practical steps for an individual forecaster: obtain the precise 2026-02-20 Yahoo close, track earnings expectations and sector news, and monitor corporate developments to inform their own probability judgment.

### Research Summary
The research defines the contract as comparing Yahoo Finance’s reported closing prices for Qnity Electronics (ticker Q, NYSE) on 2026‑02‑20 and 2026‑02‑26, using split‑adjusted “Close” values. A “Yes” outcome occurs if the 2026‑02‑26 close is strictly higher than the 2026‑02‑20 close; otherwise, the outcome is “No.” If there is a stock split or reverse split, split‑adjusted prices are used; if the stock is delisted before 2026‑02‑26, the last available close before delisting substitutes for the 2026‑02‑26 value. The research notes some unresolved edge cases (e.g., trading halts or exchange closures on 2026‑02‑26) but treats the operational question as a straightforward comparison of Yahoo Finance closing prices on the two dates.

### Research Summary
The research defines the question in terms of Ford Motor Company’s (ticker: F) adjusted closing prices on Yahoo Finance, comparing the split‑adjusted close on 2026‑02‑20 with that on 2026‑02‑26. A “Yes” outcome is when the 2026‑02‑26 adjusted close is strictly higher than the 2026‑02‑20 adjusted close; otherwise, the outcome is “No.” If Ford is delisted before 2026‑02‑26, the final Yahoo Finance close is used, and if there is a stock split, both prices are compared on a split‑adjusted basis. The research notes minor ambiguities (e.g., trading halts) but assumes Yahoo’s standard “Close/Adj Close” for the regular session.

To inform thinking about this comparison, the research summarizes Ford’s recent fundamentals, strategy, and context. Ford reported a large Q4 2025 earnings miss and a 2025 net loss of $8.2B driven by roughly $19.5B in EV‑related charges, despite record revenue of $187.3B and $6.8B in adjusted EBIT. Management guides to higher 2026 adjusted EBIT ($8–10B) and is pivoting toward hybrids, profitable trucks, and Ford Pro while scaling back EV ambitions. Analysts generally rate the stock as “Hold” or “Sector Perform,” citing quality and warranty costs, higher labor expenses from the UAW contract, and ongoing EV division losses, even after a strong ~38% total return in 2025. Consensus 2026 price targets cluster in the low‑ to mid‑teens, implying modest upside with significant uncertainty. The broader backdrop includes flat or slightly declining U.S. auto sales, slowing EV adoption, and macro factors such as interest rates and overall market risk sentiment. The research also notes that no existing prediction‑market contract directly addresses this specific short‑term price comparison, so there is no market‑implied probability available for the 2026‑02‑20 vs 2026‑02‑26 close question.

### Research Summary
The research defines the resolution in terms of HAL’s adjusted closing prices from Yahoo Finance. The key comparison is between the adjusted close on 2026-02-22 and the adjusted close associated with 2026-02-28. A “YES” outcome occurs if the split‑adjusted close on the comparison date is strictly higher than the split‑adjusted close on 2026-02-22; otherwise, the outcome is “NO.” If HAL is delisted (e.g., due to merger or bankruptcy) before 2026-02-28, the final split‑adjusted close on its last trading day (from Yahoo Finance) is compared to the 2026-02-22 close using the same higher/lower rule. Stock splits and reverse splits are explicitly to be accounted for via adjusted prices.

The main technical ambiguity is that 2026-02-28 is a Saturday, when U.S. markets are normally closed and Yahoo Finance typically has no trading data. The research notes that the question text does not specify whether to use the last trading day before (2026-02-27) or the next trading day after (2026-03-02), and this could materially affect resolution; it recommends clarifying the platform’s convention. The research also highlights that multiple “close” fields exist in Yahoo Finance, but assumes the standard daily adjusted close will be used. It outlines categories of factors that could influence HAL’s price between the two dates (oil & gas macro conditions, company fundamentals, sector performance, events, and technicals), but does not provide any actual price data for 2026-02-22 or beyond, nor any forecast; it only explains how those factors would map into a YES or NO outcome under the defined rules.

### Research Summary
The research defines the resolution mechanics for the question using Halliburton (HAL) prices from Yahoo Finance. The outcome will be based on HAL’s *adjusted close* on 2026-02-22 versus 2026-02-28, with a YES outcome if the 2026-02-28 adjusted close is strictly higher, and NO otherwise. Adjusted prices are intended to account for stock splits or reverse splits, but not necessarily for dividends. If HAL is delisted or acquired before or on 2026-02-28, the “final close price” will be used for comparison; if that final close occurs before 2026-02-22, both dates would effectively use the same final price, implying a NO outcome. There is an unresolved ambiguity if 2026-02-28 is a non-trading day, since the rules do not clearly specify whether to use the prior or next trading day, and the research suggests checking how similar questions have been resolved historically on the platform.

The research then outlines what could drive HAL’s price between the two dates and what to monitor. Key macro drivers include global oil and gas prices, upstream capex, rig and frac spread counts, and any major events such as OPEC+ decisions, geopolitical shocks, or macroeconomic data that might move energy stocks in that week. Company-specific factors include the impact of Q4 2025 earnings and 2026 guidance (likely already released by late February 2026), any investor events, ex-dividend dates, capital allocation decisions, and trends in international/offshore activity, digital offerings, and margins.

### Research Summary
The research outlines that the question will be resolved using the official TSA daily passenger volume data, specifically summing the number of passengers screened at TSA checkpoints for each day from Monday, February 16, 2026, through Sunday, February 22, 2026. The TSA’s “Total Traveler Throughput” metric, which includes all passengers screened, is the standard figure used for such questions, and the week is defined as Monday through Sunday to match TSA’s reporting format. The authoritative source for this data is the TSA’s passenger volumes page ([https://www.tsa.gov/travel/passenger-volumes](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/passenger-volumes)), and recent weekly data is available in the TSA FOIA Reading Room.

Recent news and data indicate that TSA passenger volumes have been reaching record highs, with consistent double-digit year-over-year growth since 2020, reflecting strong recovery and demand for air travel. As of February 15, 2026, there are no reports of major disruptions (such as pandemics or significant weather events) that would be expected to impact passenger volumes for the specified week. No active prediction markets were found that specifically address TSA passenger volumes for these dates. The resolution of the question will rely strictly on the TSA’s published data for February 16–22, 2026.
