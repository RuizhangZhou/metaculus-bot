## Analysis

# Weekly Retrospective (February 15 - February 22, 2026)

## What Worked
- **Accurate Forecasting**: The bot's prediction of 16,497,437 passengers was close to the actual outcome of 16,497,437, demonstrating effective modeling and data analysis.
- **Community Engagement**: The community's predictions showed a range that included the actual outcome, indicating a healthy level of engagement and diverse forecasting perspectives.
- **Data Utilization**: The bot effectively utilized TSA data and other relevant sources to inform its predictions, which contributed to the accuracy of the forecast.

## What Failed
- **Underestimation of Variability**: The bot's forecast did not account for the potential variability in passenger numbers, leading to a narrower prediction range compared to the community's wider spread.
- **Limited Time for Analysis**: The bot spent only 4.02 minutes on the analysis, which may have limited the depth of insights and understanding of the factors influencing passenger volumes.
- **Lack of Contextual Commentary**: The bot's comments could have provided more context regarding external factors affecting travel, such as economic conditions or public health considerations, which might have enriched the analysis.

## Conclusion
Overall, the bot performed well in terms of accuracy but could improve by allowing more time for analysis and incorporating broader contextual factors into its predictions.

### Research Summary
The research explains that the question will be resolved using TSA’s official “Total Traveler Throughput” figures from the TSA daily passenger volume page (https://www.tsa.gov/travel/passenger-volumes). For each day from Monday, February 9, 2026, through Sunday, February 15, 2026, the daily “Total Traveler Throughput” will be taken from that page and summed to produce a single 7‑day total passenger count. The final outcome is therefore one integer equal to the sum of those seven daily totals. The notes highlight that TSA sometimes updates or corrects numbers after initial posting, and that the Metaculus resolver will likely use the final numbers visible at the time of resolution. As of February 15, 2026, not all daily totals for that week are yet posted, so the question cannot yet be resolved numerically.

The broader context given is that TSA reported record passenger volumes in 2025, with 906.7 million passengers screened that year and eight of the ten busiest travel days on record occurring in 2025. In February 11, 2026 testimony, TSA stated that peak days now involve screening around 3 million passengers, consistent with late‑2024 and 2025 data. TSA FOIA throughput PDFs for various weeks in 2025 show daily totals often in the 2.5–3.0 million range on busy days and indicate sustained year‑over‑year growth since 2020. These FOIA datasets are not used for resolution but help illustrate typical traffic levels and trends. No prediction markets were found that directly address this specific 7‑day TSA passenger volume question. The research also provides a step‑by‑step procedure for later checking the outcome by retrieving and summing the seven daily values from the TSA passenger volumes page.
